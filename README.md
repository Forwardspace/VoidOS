# VoidOS
A simple OS, don't expect much.
## Version 0.0.3
(Rewritten)

Added some misc. functions like memcpy, strlen, ...

### Possible uses
* Still none
### Features
* Printing on screen
* Halting
* Scrolling (Yes, truly the pinnacle of software engineering!)

## Installation
(You need to have a i386-elf cross compiler installed.)

### Linux
Run `make all link final`. You can now burn the `voidos.iso` file to a USB drive or a CD, or simulate it, if you have qemu installed, by running `./simulate.sh`. Enjoy its full uselessness!

### Windows
Install linux and run steps for Linux.

### Mac OS X
Install a virtual machine and Windows in it, then run steps for Windows. Also, make sure to donate at least $50, it won't work without that as I don't like Macs!
